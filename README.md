# Train Spam Detector Algorithm

In this script, I try to train the spam detector algorithm by using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn. with help of pandas read the CSV file.
Pop the "class" column as target. Use RandomForestClassifier for training. Using the predict method and accuracy_score function for calculating the accuracy of the algorithm.
